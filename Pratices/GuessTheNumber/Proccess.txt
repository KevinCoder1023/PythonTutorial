# Based on the instruction, we can find out some key points:
    1. Input: User to insert value.
    2. Random: system generates a random number.
    3. Datatype float: Since system generates a random number with 2 decimal points,we have to control the type.
    4. If-Else statement: Different input will generate different results.
    5. Exit: Program/Game will be terminated after we can see the results.

# Things to note:
    - Do we need to return any error message ?
    - What happens if user key-ed in a random value that is not number ?
